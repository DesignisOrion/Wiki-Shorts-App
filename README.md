# Wiki Shorts App

### About 
A project allowing you to summarize your wiki article of choice.

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Wikipedia ( pip install wikipedia ) *yes they have a module in python LOL.

### What I learned:

Have you ever read a wiki article? If you know like I know... they can get a bit lengthy, especially within the summary part. With this program, I was able to get the first 5 lines of the article. I learned you can change it to any amount that you desire.
